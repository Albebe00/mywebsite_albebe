I have played many sports in my life: 
 
 * Football
 * Rugby
 * Tennis
 * Swimming
 * Ping-Pong

All of which I have mastered of course :). 

### Football

From a young age football has been my go to for school breaks and free-time. I played as **center attacking midfielder** or **striker** in my football club [Duet](https://www.sportingduetacademy.com/). We traveled to other countries for international competitions. The most prestigious competition we attended is the [Dana cup](https://www.danacup.dk/en/) where we battled our way to the finals.

knitr::include_graphics(c("/img/foot_cup.jpg"),error= FALSE)
```


### Rugby

Rugby took a big part of my sports career. I played inside-striker for the [Rugby Ironsides](https://www.ironsidesrugby.com/), the one who is supposed to tackle the big guys. This proves that size doesn't matter and your real power is your will. 

```{r, echo= FALSE, error= FALSE,  fig.show= 'hold', fig.align='center', out.width= "70%", out.height= "20%"}
knitr::include_graphics(c("/img/rugby.jpg"),error= FALSE)
```
