<p>All of which I have mastered of course :).</p>
<p>###Football</p>
<p>From a young age football has been my go to for school breaks and free-time. I played as <strong>center attacking midfielder</strong> or <strong>striker</strong> in my football club <a href="https://www.sportingduetacademy.com/">Duet</a>. We traveled to other countries for international competitions. The most prestigious competition we attended is the <a href="https://www.danacup.dk/en/">Dana cup</a> where we battled our way to the finals.</p>
