<p><strong>Python</strong> entered my life about 1 year ago and has not left my side since. I was first initiated to <strong>python</strong> when I was confronted with an assignment I had to hand in. I developed a <em>crypto-trading bot</em>. It was as hard as it seems, especially with no past experience in coding. Eventually <em>python</em> became my friend. I coded various algorithms during my internship at <a href="https://www.spglobal.com/en/">S&amp;P Global</a>. One algorithm calculated the under-performing stocks in an ETF. <em>Python</em> followed me when I followed an intense program at <a href="https://professional.mit.edu/course-catalog/applied-data-science-program">MIT</a> where I discovered itâ€™s true power.</p>

<li>In this section I will focus on my final project I handed in.</li>
