<h3>Football</h3>
<p>From a young age football has been my go to for school breaks and free-time. I played as <strong>center attacking midfielder</strong> or <strong>striker</strong> in my football club <a href="https://www.sportingduetacademy.com/">Duet</a>. We traveled to other countries for international competitions. The most prestigious competition we attended is the <a href="https://www.danacup.dk/en/">Dana cup</a> where we battled our way to the finals.</p>

<h3>Rugby</h3>
<p>Rugby took a big part of my sports career. I played inside-striker for the <a href="https://www.ironsidesrugby.com/">Rugby Ironsides</a>, the one who is supposed to tackle the big guys. This proves that size doesnâ€™t matter and your real power is your will.</p>
